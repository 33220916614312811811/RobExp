Description: We provide an outlier robust alternative for the function ``ets" of the ``forecast"-package of Hyndman and Khandakar (2008). For each method of a class of exponential smoothing variants we made a robust alternative. The class includes methods with a damped trend and/or seasonal components. The robust method is developed by robustifying every aspect of the original exponential smoothing variant. We provide robust forecasting equations, robust initial values, robust smoothing parameter estimation and a robust information criterion. The method is described in more detail in Crevits and Croux (2016).
